/**
 * Cache for `runAllChecks` results.
 *
 * Diagnostics answer one question: *do the hooks work for this app
 * process right now?* The hooks themselves are fixed at process
 * creation time — kmod loads at boot, LSPosed injects into
 * system_server at its boot, Zygisk hooks fire at zygote fork —
 * so a run's result is valid for the entire lifetime of this app
 * process. Re-running every tab switch is pure waste.
 *
 * State machine:
 * - [State.NotRun] — fresh, nothing attempted yet.
 * - [State.Running] — a run is in flight.
 * - [State.VpnOff] — last run aborted because no active VPN was
 *   detected. User gets a "turn on VPN, then retry" banner.
 * - [State.Ready] — results captured; exposed to both the Dashboard
 *   protection panel and the Diagnostics screen.
 *
 * Once [State.Ready] is reached, [run] becomes a no-op — results don't
 * change mid-process. The only path back to "please retry" requires
 * killing the process (new launch = fresh cache) or calling [reset]
 * (currently unused; reserved for explicit force-refresh flows, e.g.
 * "new kernel module just installed, please verify from a fresh
 * process" style prompts if we ever want them).
