# Reads /data/adb/vpnhide_ports/observers.txt (one package name per line)
# and installs iptables REJECT rules that block each observer's UID from
# reaching any port on 127.0.0.1 / ::1. Used for hiding locally-bound
# VPN/proxy daemons from apps that probe via connect(127.0.0.1, PORT).
#
# Package names are resolved to UIDs at apply time so reinstalls (which
# rotate an app's UID) are picked up on the next boot or Save — a stale
# UID never sticks. Same pattern as kmod's service.sh.
#
# Callable from service.sh at boot and from the VPNHide Next app via su.
# Idempotent: flushes our chain and rebuilds atomically via
# iptables-restore --noflush. Jump from OUTPUT is added only if missing.
#
# v4 and v6 restores are independent operations — if v6 fails mid-way,
# v4 rules are already live. The exit code reflects both so the caller
# can surface partial-apply, but the chain state is not transactional
# across families.
