# Contributing to vpnhide_next

Thanks for your interest. This file covers the contribution **process**; for build and setup instructions see [docs/development.md](docs/development.md).

## Before you start

- For non-trivial changes, open an issue first to discuss the approach.
- Make sure your change builds locally and passes the CI lints listed in [docs/development.md](docs/development.md#ci-lints-run-before-pushing).

## Commits

Use conventional-style prefixes, matching the existing history:

- `fix:` — bug fix
- `feat:` — new feature
- `refactor:` — code change without behaviour change
- `docs:` — documentation only
- `chore:` — tooling, release, CI, build
- `ci:` — CI-only changes

Scope the prefix where useful: `fix(zygisk): …`, `feat(lsposed): …`, `fix(kmod): …`.

Keep messages focused on *why*, not *what* — the diff already shows what changed.

## Changelog entry (required for user-visible changes)

Before opening a PR, add a changelog entry:

```sh
./scripts/changelog.py <type> "<EN text>" "<RU text>"
# types: added | changed | fixed | removed | deprecated | security
```

This writes a new Markdown fragment to `changelog.d/`. That's the only file changed — `CHANGELOG.md` is regenerated only at release time, which is what keeps concurrent PRs from conflicting. Commit just the fragment alongside your code change. Run `./scripts/preview-changelog.py` to see the pending entries together.

**Skip the entry** for internal refactors with no behaviour change, docs-only, CI-only, and test-only changes.

See [docs/changelog.md](docs/changelog.md) for the full changelog workflow.

## Pull requests

- Target the `main` branch.
- Keep PRs focused — one logical change per PR.
- Include a "why" in the PR description, and a brief "Testing" section if you verified anything manually that CI doesn't cover (hardware testing, specific device models, edge cases).
- CI must pass before merge.

## Code style

All style is enforced by CI — run the checks locally before pushing:

- Rust: `cargo fmt` + `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
- C: `clang-format` against `kmod/vpnhide_kmod.c`
- Kotlin: `ktlint`
- Android: `./gradlew :app:lint`
